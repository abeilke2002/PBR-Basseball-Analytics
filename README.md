# Prep Baseball Report Data Analytics Questions


## Description
##### This code was used to answer questions using advanced analytical methods and graphics to better understand the decisions some teams make. Some questions that were answered were correlation between On Base Percentage and Slugging Percentage, and relationship between shifts and DRS.

## Running the Code

##### 1. Load necessary packages Tidyverse and ggrepel.
##### 2. Load necessary dataframes from the Lahman Database, Baseball Savant, and FanGraphs.

## Results

##### The results of the first question was that hitters who hit more than 20 home runs last year, came out to have the most significant relationship between both On Base Percentage and Slugging Percentage.
##### The teams who had the highest wRC+ performed the best when it came to finishing at the top of the division. It was also shown that batting average doesn't do a great job at predicting wins.
##### Teams who shift the least had the highest Defensive Runs Saved numbers. Teams who shift the most have the highest fielding percentage.
